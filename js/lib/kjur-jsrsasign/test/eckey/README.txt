
ECC keys test vector

This folder provides ECC private and public keys and ECDSA signatures generated by OpenSSL
for jsrsasign ECDSA test vectors.

FILES:

- aaa.txt - message text "aaa" to be signed
- k1.* secp256r1 curve ECC keys and SHA256,SHA1 with ECDSA signatures.
- k2.* secp192k1 curve ECC keys and SHA256 with ECDSA signatures.
- k3.* secp224r1 curve ECC keys and SHA256 with ECDSA signatures.
- k4.* secp256k1 curve ECC keys and SHA256 with ECDSA signatures.
- k5.* secp521r1 curve ECC keys and SHA256 with ECDSA signatures.
- k6.* secp384r1 curve ECC keys and SHA256 with ECDSA signatures.

- for each k* set
  - k?.memo.txt		note for generating key and signatures
  - k?.pem		PEM formatted EC private key
  - k?.pub.pem		PEM formatted EC public key
  - k?.pub.der		DER formatted EC public key
  - k?.sig.*.*		ECDSA signatures
