webfts
======

WebFTS is a web-delivered file transfer and management solution which allows users to invoke reliable, 
managed data transfers on distributed infrastructures. The fully open source solution offers a simple 
graphical interface through which the power of the FTS3 service can be accessed without the installation 
of any special grid tools. Created following simplicity and efficiency criteria, WebFTS allows the user to 
access and interact with multiple storage elements. Their content becomes browsable and different filters 
can be applied to get a set of files to be transferred. Transfers can be invoked and capabilities are provided 
for checking the detailed status of the different transfers and resubmitting any of them with only one click.
The “transfer engine” used is FTS3, the service responsible for distributing the majority of LHC data across 
WLCG infrastructure. This provides WebFTS with reliable, multi-protocol (gridftp, srm, http, xrootd), 
adaptively optimised data transfers.
